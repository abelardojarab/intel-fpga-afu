This tree holds MPF software libraries for controlling MPF shims on FPGAs.

The library build is configured by CMake.  Starting in the directory
holding this README:
    
    mkdir build
    cmake ../
    make

The build directory may be anywhere -- just adjust the path passed to CMake.

To select an installation directory, set -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir>
on the CMake command line.  The MPF library and header file installation
paths are layed out so they may be embedded in the standard Intel-provided
FPGA library and header file trees.

Set -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug on the CMake command line to emit symbols and
eliminate optimization.

Warning: the CMake "Release" build type causes errors and is not currently
supported.
