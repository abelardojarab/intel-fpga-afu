// CRC Checksum Aligner
//	Main to match the same latancy performance with CRC Compiler (Generator only)
//
// Author:
// Cher Jier Yap 	- 05-09-2012 
//   
// Revision:
// 05-09-2012 - intial version
// 06-09-2012 - CRC_ENA_IN naming change to PKT_TRANSFER_STATUS_IN to avoid confusion with the CRC_ENA output from CRC_ethernet.v
//					Main reason is that PKT_TRANSFER_STATUS_IN cannot have deassertion during a packet transfer but CRC_ENA from CRC_ethernet.v
//					allow deassertion during pkt transfer. 
// 13-09-2012 - PKT_TRANSFER_STATUS_IN input drop due to the CRC_Ethernet.v now able to perform init and crc calculation (EOP) at the same clock cycle
//			  - PKT_TRANSFER_STATUS_IN change to CRC_CHECKSUM_LATCH_IN which is only valid for 1 clock cycle to latch the CRC output  					
// 14-09-2012 - Enhancement:
//					1. Re-architecture the crc_checksum_aligner where variable latency can define through parameter
