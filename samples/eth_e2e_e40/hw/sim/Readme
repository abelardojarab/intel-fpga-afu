ETH_E2E_E10 Modelsim Simulation Script

This directory contains files to perform a modelsim test loopback simulation of the ETH_E2E_E10 AFU.

Files:
	./include - include directory with platform specific files requied by the testbench.
	tb.av - top level testbench file which wraps the AFU.
	Makefile - makefile script which targets Modelsim SE.
	
Requirements:
	Modelsim SE - This testbench was tested using Modelsim SE 10.6c.
	Quartus Prime Pro 17.1.1 or newer - Quartus is required to compile Intel FPGA-specific libraries.
	
Commands:
	make - This command deletes the local work area then compiles all nessisary RTL and starts a commandline based simulation with optimizations on.
	make debug - This command deletes the local work area then compiles all nessisary RTL and starts a gui based simulation with no optimization on and full waveform logging.
	make clean - This command cleans only the work area.
	make clobber - This command cleans the work area, the IP specific libraries and the FPGA specific libraries.
