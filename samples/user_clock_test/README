Validate the frequencies of clocks passed in to the AFU's top-level.  Clock
cycles are counted for each clock during a sampling window.  The counts are
exported as CSRs, using MMIO reads.

The frequency of uClk is specified as "auto" in the AFU's JSON file
(hw/rtl/user_clock_test.json), causing the uClk frequency to be chosen
based on the timing achieved following placement and routing.  This mode is
similar to OpenCL's clock management, in which frequency may vary
with different seeds.
